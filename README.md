# ELitmus-Puzzle

The basic idea of the project is to develop a puzzle that measures the soft skills of a person. For the project when the user logins to the page he finds a homepage that displays two cards. Where one card is for the Crossword and other is for the questions. In the crossword when the user checks for the solution and finds the solution is correct it will pop up a MCQ question. After completion of crossword it will analyse the solutions to give the analysis for both Crossword and MCQ's answered. In the Questions card it will also prompt for the MCQ Questions and analyse the solution given. Basing on the constraints we have taken we will try to analyse the analytical skills, technical skills, critical thinking, and many more skills. For this project I have developed a Signup & Login page to authenticate the users but this page is just static one and with that the pop up of the Crossword part is also pending.
